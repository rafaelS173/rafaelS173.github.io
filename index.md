## Favortie CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1
    I enjoyed this lab as it was my first introduction to coding and computer science. It was easy and a 
     great intro to coding, as I have never coded in my life. The instructions were clear, easy, and paved the way for future labs. 

* Lab 2
    Lab 2 was another easy lab as we were introduced to strings. Strings were a important past of this  class as we used them throughout all the labs. The instructions were kind of confusing but me and my partner were able to finish it. 

* Lab 12
    The final was a combination of all the labs and what we did within those labs. We also did new things as we were able to create GIFs that was first introduced at the beginning of the semester. The code was challenging as the new color concepts took some time to get used to. Overall as the last lab I think it worked.
